## Introduction

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs like Llama 2.0 excel at generating coherent text based on the data they were trained on, they can struggle when asked about information beyond their training data, leading to inaccuracies or hallucinations. RAG systems address this limitation by combining the generative abilities of LLMs with external data retrieval processes.

In a RAG system, when a question is asked, a **retriever** component first searches for relevant information from a vector databaseâ€”where the data has been encoded into vector representations. Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the **generator** component, typically a LLM, uses this information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.

By integrating tools like **Langchain** for orchestration and **ChromaDB** as the vector database, RAG systems enable more accurate and up-to-date responses without the need for fine-tuning the LLM itself. This approach is particularly valuable for scenarios where the information needs to be dynamic and continuously updated, such as customer service, research, and knowledge management.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Llama 2.0**, **Langchain**, and **ChromaDB**. This will allow us to ask questions about documents not included in the training data, without the need for fine-tuning the Large Language Model (LLM). The RAG process works as follows:

- **Retrieval step:** Fetch relevant documents from a special database, typically a vector database where these documents have been indexed.
  
## Key Definitions

- **LLM (Large Language Model):** A type of AI model designed for understanding and generating human-like text.
- **Llama 2.0:** A large language model developed by Meta.
- **Langchain:** A framework to streamline the development of applications utilizing LLMs.
- **Vector Database:** A database that organizes data using high-dimensional vectors.
- **ChromaDB:** A specific type of vector database.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Combines external resources with LLMs to enhance their capabilities.

## Model Details

- **Model:** Llama 2
- **Variation:** 7b-chat-hf (7B parameters, Hugging Face build)
- **Version:** V1
- **Framework:** PyTorch

The LLaMA 2 model is pretrained and fine-tuned on 2 trillion tokens and contains 7 to 70 billion parameters, making it one of the most powerful open-source models, with significant improvements over LLaMA 1.

## What is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System?

- **Challenge:** LLMs can generate accurate responses for topics they were trained on but often hallucinate when asked about information outside their training data.
  
- **Solution:** RAG systems combine external resources with LLMs to enhance their capabilities. The two main components are:
  - **Retriever:** Encodes data so that relevant parts can be retrieved using text embeddings (vector representations). A vector database is ideal for implementing a retriever (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).
  - **Generator:** An LLM generates responses based on the retrieved data. In this project, a quantized LLaMA v2 model will be used.

- **Orchestration:** Langchain will orchestrate the retriever and generator. Langchain provides a specialized function to create the retriever-generator combination with minimal code.
