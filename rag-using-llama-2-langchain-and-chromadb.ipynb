This will allow us to ask questions about our documents (that were not included in the training data), without fine-tunning the Large Language Model (LLM).\n","When using RAG, if you are given a question, you first do a retrieval step to fetch any relevant documents from a special database, a vector database where these documents were indexed. \n","\n","## Definitions\n","\n","* LLM - Large Language Model  \n","* Llama 2.0 - LLM from Meta \n","* Langchain - a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs\n","* Vector database - a database that organizes data through high-dimmensional vectors  \n","* ChromaDB - vector database  \n","* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (see below more details about RAGs)\n","\n","## Model details\n","\n","* **Model**: Llama 2  \n","* **Variation**: 7b-chat-hf  (7b: 7B dimm. hf: HuggingFace build)\n","* **Version**: V1  \n","* **Framework**: PyTorch  \n","\n","LlaMA 2 model is pretrained and fine-tuned with 2 Trillion tokens and 7 to 70 Billion parameters which makes it one of the powerful open source models. It is a highly improvement over LlaMA 1 model.\n","\n","\n","## What is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system?\n","\n","Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do \"not know\", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.  \n"," \n","The retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon queriying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create a vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB (persistent).\n","\n","For the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this Notebook we will use a quantized LLaMA v2 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.  \n","\n","The orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the receiver-generator in one line of code.\n","\n","## More about this  \n","\n","Do you want to learn more? Look into the `References` section for blog posts and in `More work on the same topic` for Notebooks about the technologies used here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#

It led to a severe recession, with many financial institutions failing or facing severe difficulties. The crisis was characterized by a sharp decline in consumer spending, a housing market crash, and a global recession. The crisis led to a significant increase in unemployment, with millions of people losing their jobs. The federal government responded with a series of bailouts and stimulus packages, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). These measures helped to stabilize the financial system and stimulate economic growth, but the recovery was slow and uneven. The crisis had a lasting impact on the global economy, leading to increased regulation and oversight of financial institutions, as well as a shift towards more sustainable and responsible economic practices.\n"]}],"source":["query = \"What is the cateserophic of 2008 in the money ?

Two years ago, our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience.
